## ðŸ”‘ 1.1.1 What is Internet: An Infrastructure Description
- **Internet** is network of **communication links, or packet switchs** interconnecting **end systems **and** hosts**.
- **Communication links** are made of different types of physical media such as copper wire and radio spectrum with various transmission rate(bits/seconds).
- **Packet switches** receive packet on incoming communication links and forwareds packets on outcoming communication links.
- Packet switches have two predominent types: **Router**, and **link-layer switches**.
- The communication links and packets switch traversed by packets are known as **route** or **path**.
- End systems access the Internet through **Internet Service Providers (ISPs)** such as local cable, cellular data ISPs.
- It provides us with varity of network accesses and is managed independently with IP protocol, nameing and address convention etc such as mobile wireless network. low-tier ISPs can also be interconnected with upper-tier ISPs.
- **Internet standards** are developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force(IETF). The IETF standards documents are called **requests for comments** (RFCs). They define  protocols such as TCP, IP, HTTP so that the products and system people create can interoperate.

## ðŸ”‘ 1.1.2 What is Internet: A Services Description
- **Internet** can also be seen as a infrastructure that provides services to applications that includes web surfing, e-mail and multi-person games.
- These application could be called **distributed application** since they involve multiple end systems that exchange data with each other.
- Applications are run on the end system instead of packet switches.
- End system attached to the internet provide a scoket interface that specifies how a program running
- Internet provides **socket interface** that is a set of rules to specify how the program on the end system deliver data to destinations.

## ðŸ”‘ 1.1.3 What Is a Protocol?
- All activity in the internet involving two or more communicating remote entities is governed by a protocol. 
- A **Protocol** define the format and the order of message exchanged by two or more communicating entities, as well as the actions taken on the transmission and/or receipt of a message or other event.

## ðŸ”‘ 1.2.1 Access Networks
- Host can be referred to end system, and the host could be divided into two categories:**clients** and **servers**.
- Clients tend to be desktop and mobile PCs, smartphone etc. Servers tend to be more powerful machine that store and distribute Web pages reside in large **data centers**.
- **Access network** is the network physically connects an end system to the first router(edge router) on the path from the end system to other distant end system.
